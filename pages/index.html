        <p>This is a space where Noor and Coy will write out their goals for mastery
        of various academic topics, as they are both unfortunately extreme nerds 
        who enjoy mind-stimulating activities. This site is being created the month
        of their graduation from college, and will be a running record of
        academic free-time explorations. When a new discipline/topic is 
        found to be explored, a tab will be added to the top. These tabs (currently math
        and compsci, but TBR will be added for books to be read) will be in a bar at
        the top of the page, and each will lead to a page of what's already been explored,
        and what will be later. This site is also a space to explore coding creative joy
        without judgement or expectations (ie. the compsci page will be entirely pink!!)</p>
