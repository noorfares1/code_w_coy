            <p>This is a space where Noor and Coy will write out their goals for mastery
            of various academic topics, as they are both unfortunately extreme nerds 
            who enjoy mind-stimulating activities. This site is being created the month
            of their graduation from college, and will be a running record of
            academic free-time explorations. When a new discipline/topic is 
            found to be explored, a tab will be added to the top. These tabs (currently math
            and compsci, but TBR will be added for books to be read) will be in a bar at
            the top of the page, and each will lead to a page of what's already been explored,
            and what will be later. This site is also a space to explore coding creative joy
            without judgement or expectations (ie. the compsci page will be entirely pink!!)</p>
